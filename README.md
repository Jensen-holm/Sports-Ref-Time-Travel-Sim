# Northwoods League Specific Version of the Simulator

Same functionality except this is specific to only the Northwoods league, and is based primarily on righty/lefty split stats instead
of the current season statistics found on baseball reference. This means a more specific simulation that main.y benefit the situational
analysis functions and the lineup optimization functions. run python3 main.py in terminal once navigating towards its directory, and the
program will run. Currently working on the situational analysis function, and thinking about having a "game" function where live diring a 
game i will input the outcome of every plate appearance, and see probabilities change, and reccommend managerial decisions if nessessary.

Developed to benefit the Kalamazoo Growlers as a part of my statistics internship in summer '22.
