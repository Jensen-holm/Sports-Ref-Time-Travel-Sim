# Northwoods League Specific Version of the Simulator

Same functionality except this is specific to only the Northwoods league, and is based primarily on righty/lefty split stats instead
of the current season statistics found on baseball reference. This means a more specific simulation that main.y benefit the situational
analysis functions and the lineup optimization functions.

Developed to benefit the Kalamazoo Growlers as a part of my statistics internship in summer '22.
