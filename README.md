END GOAL:

Who was more dominant, the 1975 Cincinnati Reds or the 1927 Yankees? Debates like this can now be settled through simulation analysis.
While the simulator is not currently able to answer the question of "How many home runs would Giancarlo Stanton hit in the dead ball era", 
it is able to answer the question "Who was most dominant in their respective eras." There are many burning questions it can answer through
the power of probabilistic simulation analysis. Not only with baseball, but with Hockey, Futbol, Football, and Basketball. Any level you can find on 
sports reference.

# Current Stage

Right now I am building the baseball simulator, the scraper has been completed pretty much aside from
a few minor tweaks. But once I finish major league baseball, I plan on opening it up to colligate, and foreign 
baseball as well before moving on to basketball.
